# NitroChecker

An application I found on replit which came with a bunch of nitro links in a .txt file, along with a bunch of useless Print statements in the python file to make it look like it was doing something. I improved it a bit and im just uploading it to Github for friends to use .,.

There are 10000 lines in total in the `links.txt` file, the application will check a certain amount of links you tell it to to see if they are working or not.
